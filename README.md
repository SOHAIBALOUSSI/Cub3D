## Intro
Cub3D is a raycasting-based 3D game engine developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. The goal is to simulate a 3D environment in a 2D grid world by calculating the intersections of rays with walls and projecting them to create a first-person view. This project focuses on concepts like raycasting, texture mapping, collision detection, and efficient rendering using the **MiniLibX** library.

## Features
- **Raycasting Engine:** Renders a 3D perspective from a 2D map using raycasting.
- **Texture Mapping:** Textures are applied to walls to enhance visual realism.
- **Dynamic Player Movement:** The player can move in all directions using the keyboard, and rotate the the point of view with arrows/mouse.
- **Collision Detection:** Ensures that the player cannot walk through walls.
- **Doors:** Doors behave like walls but use a different texture and are rendered conditionally.
- **Gun animation:** The player holds a gun that can shoot the shooting boards.
- **Minimap:** Yes, a minimap

## Requirements
To compile and run Cub3D, you will need:
- **Linux machine** (cuz MacOs is bad)**
- **MiniLibX** (included with the project for 42's student)
```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
```
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SOHAIBALOUSSI/Cub3D.git cub3d
   cd cub3d
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make bonus
   ```

3. Run the game and Enjoy:
   ```bash
   ./cub3d_bonus maps/shooting_range.cub
   ```

## Controls
- **W / A / S / D:** Move the player (forward, left, backward, right).
- **Left / Right Arrow:** Rotate the camera view left and right.
- **E:** Open/Close Doors.
- **Mouse:** Control the camera view freely in any direction.
- **Left mouse click:** Shoot ðŸ”«.
- **LCRTL:** Show/Hide the mouse cursor.
- **ESC:** Exit the game.

## Technical Details

1. **Raycasting Algorithm:**  
   The engine uses a modified version of the Digital Differential Analysis (DDA) algorithm for raycasting. It casts rays from the playerâ€™s position and calculates intersections with grid lines, determining the distance to walls and projecting them on the screen.

2. **Projection and Wall Rendering:**  
   Wall height is calculated based on the distance from the player, and the appropriate texture is scaled and drawn vertically for each ray. This creates the illusion of depth in a 3D environment.

3. **Player Movement and Collision Detection:**  
   The playerâ€™s position is updated based on key hooks, with collision detection ensuring that the player cannot pass through walls. Movements are based on a grid defined in the `.cub` map file.

4. **Textures:**  
   Textures are stored as images and mapped onto walls using the pixel's horizontal and vertical position. The MiniLibX library handles loading `.xpm` texture files and drawing them to the screen.

5. **Doors:**  
   Doors (represented by 'D' in the map file) behave like walls but with diffrent textures and can be opened with 'E'.
